## Writing guide

Follow FAIRmat's [NOMAD Docs Writing Guide](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-docs/blob/main/docs/writing_guide.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for anything you write here. In short:

- **Structure by [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**: a tutorial (learning-oriented, step-by-step), a how-to guide (goal-oriented, practical), an explanation (understanding-oriented, background), or a reference (information-oriented, precise). Identify which one you're writing before you start -- a page that mixes them is harder to navigate, not more complete.
- **Write for the reader's task, not the codebase's layout.** Be as detailed as needed, as concise as possible; state prerequisites up front.
- **Stay consistent**: canonical names (NOMAD, NOMAD Oasis, NORTH), `backticks` for code/file names/literal values, "double quotes" for UI text/labels/error messages, **bold** for UI elements and important emphasis, *italics* for first-introduced terms.
- **Links**: descriptive text, never bare `here`/`link`; internal links use path-hierarchy names (`[How-to > Install this Plugin](...)`); external links open in a new tab (`{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}`). Broken links fail CI -- fix them, or open an issue if you can't.
- **Admonitions**: standard titles only (e.g. `!!! warning "Attention"`, `!!! tip "Important"`); no custom ones.
- **Images sparingly** -- each one is long-term upkeep. Prefer content you can express in code: [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} diagrams first, then SVG, then JPG as a last resort.
- **Verify against the real system** before merging -- commands, output, and examples should match what actually happens.

## Build the docs locally

Docs dependencies are part of the `dev` extra (see [How-to guides > Contribute to this Plugin > Development installation](contribute_to_this_plugin.md#development-installation)), so if you've already run `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`, you're set. Serve the site locally with live-reload:

```console
mkdocs serve
```

Before opening a PR, it is recommended to build with `--strict` so broken links/nav entries fail locally instead of in CI (`.github/workflows/mkdocs-deploy.yml`):

```console
mkdocs build --strict
```

## Add a new page

1. **Pick the right section** -- this repo's `docs/` layout already mirrors the Diátaxis categories:

   | Directory | Kind |
   |---|---|
   | `docs/tutorial/` | Tutorials |
   | `docs/how_to/` | How-to guides |
   | `docs/explanation/` | Explanation |
   | `docs/reference/` | Reference |

2. **Add the Markdown file** in that directory.
3. **Register it in the nav** in [`mkdocs.yml`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-north-xps/blob/main/mkdocs.yml){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} -- a page not listed there won't appear in the site, even if it builds.
4. **Images/data**: put a page's assets in an `images/`/`data/` subdirectory next to that page, not shared across pages -- e.g. `docs/how_to/images/my-diagram.svg`.
5. Preview with `mkdocs serve` and check the page renders and the nav entry shows up where you expect.
